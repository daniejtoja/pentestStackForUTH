# Pentest stack for UTH
Project created for my university class called "Security of networks and systems".

## Main goals:
- Simplify creation of environments
- Make the environments easily recreatable
- Universal process for docker enabled systems

## Prerequisites:
- Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose
- Locally built image from provided Dockerfile

## How to run:
1. Build kali linux docker image locally from provided dockerfile
  ```bash
  docker build -t localkali:latest .
  ```
2. Startup the stack using:
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```
3. Wait a bit for the stack to warm up and do all prerequisites - staring all the services
4. Display containers using:
  ```bash
    docker compose ps
  ```
  My example output:

  ```bash
  ❯ docker compose ps
    NAME                COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
    kali                "bash"                   kali                running
    metasploit          "sh -c '/bin/service…"   meta                running
  ```
5. Enter the container using:
  ```
  docker exec -it <NAME> /bin/bash
  # for example
  # docker exec -it kali /bin/bash
  ```
6. Create another tab on your terminal and enter the second container
7. You can refer to the instances in the network as kali and metasploit:
  ```bash
  # eg. (remember to use fping on Kali)
  fping -c 5 metasploit

  ping -c 5 kali

  #these should run successfully
  ```
8. Have fun!
